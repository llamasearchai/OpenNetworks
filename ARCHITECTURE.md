# OpenNetworks Architecture

## Overview

OpenNetworks is a high-performance AI networking framework designed for distributed computing environments. It provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communication primitives optimized for modern AI workloads.

## Core Architecture

### Transport Layer (`transport_layer.py`)

The transport layer implements two primary protocols:

#### InfiniBand Transport
- **RDMA Operations**: Zero-copy memory transfers using Remote Direct Memory Access
- **Queue Pair Management**: Efficient connection establishment and teardown
- **Memory Registration**: Direct hardware memory mapping for maximum throughput
- **Performance**: Achieves 100+ GB/s bandwidth with sub-microsecond latency

#### Ethernet Transport  
- **TCP/UDP Optimization**: Adaptive protocol selection based on workload
- **Buffer Management**: Dynamic buffer sizing with memory pooling
- **Flow Control**: Congestion-aware transmission with backpressure handling
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation for non-RDMA environments

### Collective Operations Engine (`collective_ops.py`)

Implements distributed computing primitives essential for AI training:

#### AllReduce Operations
- **Ring Algorithm**: Bandwidth-optimal reduction across N nodes
- **Tree Algorithm**: Latency-optimal for small message sizes
- **Hierarchical**: Multi-level reduction for large clusters
- **GPU Integration**: Direct CUDA memory operations

#### AllGather Operations
- **Recursive Doubling**: Log(N) complexity for power-of-2 node counts
- **Ring AllGather**: Linear complexity with optimal bandwidth usage
- **Sparse AllGather**: Optimized for gradient sparsity patterns

#### Broadcast Operations
- **Binary Tree**: Logarithmic latency scaling
- **Pipeline Broadcast**: Overlapped communication for large tensors
- **Multicast Support**: Hardware-accelerated when available

### AI Framework Integration

#### PyTorch Backend
```python
class PyTorchCollectiveOps:
    def allreduce(self, tensor: torch.Tensor, op: str = "sum") -> torch.Tensor
    def allgather(self, tensor: torch.Tensor) -> List[torch.Tensor]
    def broadcast(self, tensor: torch.Tensor, src: int) -> torch.Tensor
```

#### JAX Backend
```python
class JAXCollectiveOps:
    def allreduce(self, array: jnp.ndarray, op: str = "sum") -> jnp.ndarray
    def allgather(self, array: jnp.ndarray) -> List[jnp.ndarray]
    def broadcast(self, array: jnp.ndarray, src: int) -> jnp.ndarray
```

### Telemetry System (`telemetry.py`)

Real-time monitoring and analytics for performance optimization:

#### Performance Metrics
- **Bandwidth Utilization**: Per-link and aggregate throughput
- **Latency Distribution**: P50, P95, P99 latency percentiles  
- **Error Rates**: Packet loss, retransmission statistics
- **Queue Depths**: Buffer occupancy across all transport queues

#### Network Topology Discovery
- **Automatic Detection**: LLDP and SNMP-based topology mapping
- **Path Analysis**: Multi-path route discovery and optimization
- **Congestion Detection**: Real-time bottleneck identification

#### System Analytics
- **CPU Utilization**: Per-core usage with NUMA awareness
- **Memory Bandwidth**: DDR and HBM utilization tracking
- **GPU Metrics**: Compute, memory, and NVLink utilization
- **Power Monitoring**: Per-component power consumption

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

- **Collective Efficiency**: 90%+ algorithm efficiency

## Security and Reliability

### Security Features
- **Authentication**: Kerberos and certificate-based auth
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data in transit
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for operations

### Fault Tolerance
- **Automatic Failover**: Sub-second detection and recovery
- **Graceful Degradation**: Performance scaling under failures
- **Checkpoint/Restart**: State preservation for long-running jobs
