# OpenNetworks Framework

**Advanced AI Networking for High-Performance Computing**

*Author: Nik Jois <nikjois@llamasearch.ai>*

## Overview

OpenNetworks is a comprehensive networking framework designed for AI workloads on supercomputers and data centers. It provides high-performance InfiniBand and Ethernet communication with RDMA optimization and seamless integration with PyTorch and JAX.

## Features

- **High-Performance Transport**: InfiniBand and Ethernet protocols with RDMA optimization
- **Zero-Copy Operations**: RDMA-optimized data transfers for maximum throughput
- **AI Framework Integration**: Native PyTorch and JAX distributed training support
- **Collective Operations**: Custom implementations for AllReduce, AllGather, and more
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Production-grade telemetry and performance analytics
- **Network Topology Discovery**: Automatic detection and optimization
- **Fault Tolerance**: Production-ready error handling and recovery

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nikjois/opennetworks.git
cd opennetworks

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the interactive CLI
python neurallink.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from neurallink import OpenNetworksConfig, OpenNetworksCLI
from collective_ops import CollectiveOperationsEngine
import numpy as np

# Initialize configuration
config = OpenNetworksConfig()

# Start collective operations
collective_ops = CollectiveOperationsEngine(config)
collective_ops.initialize()

# Perform AllReduce operation
data = np.random.randn(1000).astype(np.float32)
result = collective_ops.allreduce(data, op="sum")
```

## Architecture

The framework consists of several key components:

- **Transport Layer**: High-performance InfiniBand and Ethernet implementations
- **Collective Operations**: Optimized distributed computing primitives
- **Telemetry System**: Real-time performance monitoring and analytics
- **CLI Interface**: Interactive command-line interface for testing and monitoring

## Performance

OpenNetworks is designed for maximum performance:

- **Bandwidth**: Up to 100+ GB/s with InfiniBand RDMA
- **Latency**: Sub-microsecond communication latencies
- **Scalability**: Supports thousands of nodes in distributed deployments
- **Efficiency**: Zero-copy operations minimize CPU overhead
